# USD2CNY
A java CLI program to get the real time exchange rate between USD and CNY. For self use.

It is actually an **example** of the use of jsoup and regex. At the mean time, I care about the exchange rate between USD and CNY, thus the program is created.

It also shows a basic method to create a java web program.

------

The exchange rate is refered to a site, and the source can be changed as long as you want.
